# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using AI

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is an AI-based image classification tool designed to detect plant diseases using deep learning. It allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf as an input, and the trained model will predict the disease class affecting it ,if any, along with a confidence score. The tool is built using TensorFlow and Keras, It supports various image formats and automatically preprocesses the image to make accurate predictions.and designed for simplicity ,it can run easily on Google Colab without any need for local  setup.The project is ideal for farmers, students, researchers, and gardening enthusiasts looking for a quick and reliable way to detect plant diseases.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Agriculture is often affected by plant diseases that reduce yield and crop quality.Diseases in plants reduce agricultural productivity and often go unnoticed until it's too late. Early detection is critical but manual identification is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to error and not always accessible to all. With increasing access to smartphones and the internet, an automated, AI-powered solution is the need of the hour. This project solves that by offering an easy-to-use tool where users can simply upload an image and get an instant diagnosis using a pre-trained CNN model.Farmers, students, or researchers can simply upload a leaf image and receive an instant disease classification, helping in early detection and prevention.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts plant images of *any size or format* (.jpg, .png, etc.)
- Predicts plant diseases using a *trained deep learning model*
- Shows a *confidence score* for each prediction
- Runs entirely on *Google Colab*, no installations needed
- Easy to customize with your own dataset or model

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- *Python*
- *TensorFlow / Keras*
- *NumPy*
- *PIL (Python Imaging Library)*
- *Google Colab for execution*

---

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Upload your *trained model (.keras format)*.
3. Upload any plant image (can be in any format/dimensions).
4. The code processes the image and outputs:
   - Predicted disease class
   - Confidence percentage

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Predicting diseases like *Leaf Blight, **Rust, **Mildew*,*headcabbage*, etc.
- Apple Black Rot
- Potato early blight
- Tomato laef mold
  
---

## 📌 Note

- This project uses a .keras model file (Keras v3 format).
- You can easily retrain or fine-tune the model for your own plant species or disease dataset.
- No prior machine learning knowledge is needed to use the code.

## 👩‍🌾 Future Scope

- Integration with a mobile camera for real-time prediction.
- Support for multi-class predictions or severity scoring.
- Offline prediction using lightweight models like MobileNet.
